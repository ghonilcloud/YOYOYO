Create a box plot to compare the distribution of data from two different groups, each containing an odd number of data points. Interpret the box plots to compare the central tendency, spread, and potential outliers between the groups.
You are given the following data sets for two groups:
Group A: 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16
Group B: 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, 15, 18
	
	Tasks:
Calculate the five-number summary (minimum, 1st quartile Q1, median, 3rd quartile Q3, and maximum) for each group.
Draw the box plots for both groups on the same axis, labelling the minimum, Q1, median, Q3, and maximum values.
Compare the distributions of the two groups based on the box plots:
Which group has a higher median?
Are there any outliers

A card is drawn from a standard deck of 52 cards, and then a coin is flipped. What is the probability of drawing a “King” from the deck and flipping a “Tail”?

Hours of Sunlight (X); Height (cm) (y)
2 10
4 15
6 20
8 25
10 30


EXERCISE 5

EXERCISE 6

A company claims their light bulbs last 1000 hours on average. A sample of 10 bulbs yields the following lifespans (in hours):
950, 960, 970, 980, 1020, 1030, 990, 1010, 1000, 995
